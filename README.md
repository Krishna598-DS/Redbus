# Redbus
🚍 RedBus Data Scraping and Interactive Filtering App
🌟 Overview
This project combines the power of data scraping, database management, and an interactive web application to extract and visualize bus information from the RedBus platform. It's a practical tool for exploring bus routes, filtering options, and ticket details dynamically.

🛠️ Features
Data Scraping: Extract detailed bus route and availability data for 10 states using Selenium.
Database Management: Store the data in a structured SQL database for efficient querying.
Interactive Web Application: Use Streamlit to filter, explore, and display bus details in real time.

Collect information about bus routes, timings, fares, and ratings from RedBus.
Save data from multiple pages across 12 states for public and private buses.
Store Data in SQL:

Organize scraped data into a structured table (bus_routes).
Ensure easy access and management of data for future use.
Build a User-Friendly Application:

Enable users to:
Filter by state, route, rating, price, and seat availability.
View bus details dynamically.
